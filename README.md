## My education and work experience
My strength lies in well-rounded education, combining technical and soft skills. I graduated high school with an advanced mathematics profile, earned a master's degree in corporate management, a bachelor's degree in philosophy, and further expanded my education with certificates and postgraduate studies in financial accounting, data analysis and visualization, programming, and data science. I continue to actively develop these competencies.

I am familiar with working in an international environment and have experience in dealing with business clients. I have been involved in analyzing the market environment of companies, financial reports, internal company statistics related to areas such as team and process efficiency, and product quality. Currently, I am working with large datasets from the insurance markets.

Dedicating a lot of time to learning and self-improvement is very important to me. In 2023, I even found myself on the cover of [Coursera's Learner Outcomes Report!](https://about.coursera.org/press/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Learner-Outcomes-Report-2023.pdf)

Currently I work as a professional data analyst, primarily focusing on technical tasks related to process reengineering.
